Programme for optimizing, simulating and creating 3D printable HEDGEHOGs (3D range modulators for proton therapy)

Steps:
1. install pyg4ometry version 1.0.4
2. clone repo.
3. copy mat.txt into pyg4ometry package files "pyg4ometry/geant4/nist_materials.txt" and elem.txt into "pyg4ometry/geant4/nist_elements.txt". This may get fixed soon...
4. place usims and template.inp in same directory as scripts.
