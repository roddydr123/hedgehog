explaining all the files here:

upbeam: full beamline template with hhog in wedge position.
beamline: full beamline template with hhog downstream of col#2.
fullblock: underlying simulation input for wedge position.
PMMA: underlying sim input for downstream col#2 positon.
reverse: full beamline template with hhog downstream of col#2 but pins facing upstream.
sram_both_anglecol_ab: full beam geometry template written by someone else.
template: original template for no beam geometry.
gtemplate36: template for gaussian beam but no geometry.
